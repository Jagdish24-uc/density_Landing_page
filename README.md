## Description

### Challenges:

1. **Relative Image Paths:**
   Images are referenced with relative paths like `/frame6.svg` and `/shadow@2x.png`. When deploying to different environments, the base URL may change, leading to broken image links.

   **Solution:**
   Used Gatsby's `gatsby-plugin-image` for optimized images. Import images using `import { StaticImage } from "gatsby-plugin-image";` and use the `StaticImage` component with a relative path.

2. **Styling Consistency:**
   Maintaining consistent styles across the application can be challenging, especially as the project grows. 

   **Solution:**
   Considered  a design system or CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled Components for a more organized and maintainable styling approach. This can help in creating reusable components and consistent styling.

3. **Responsive Design:**
   Does not show responsiveness considerations. Ensuring the landing page looks good on various devices and screen sizes is crucial.

   **Solution:**
   We can Implement responsive design using media queries or a responsive design framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS. Test the page on different devices to ensure a good user experience.

4. **SEO Optimization:**
   Does not include any SEO-related elements like meta tags, which are essential for search engine optimization.

   **Solution:**
  We can  Use Gatsby's SEO components or add meta tags manually to improve SEO. Consider using plugins like `gatsby-plugin-react-helmet` for managing head elements.

5. **Accessibility:**
   Accessibility considerations, such as proper alt text for images and ensuring a good focus order, are crucial for a user-friendly experience.

   **Solution:**
   It could be done by Ensuring that all images have meaningful `alt` attributes. Test the site with screen readers and keyboard navigation to ensure accessibility compliance.

6. **Data Fetching:**
   If dynamic content is intended for this landing page, there's no indication of data fetching. Dynamic content may come from a headless CMS or other data sources.

   **Solution:**
   we can Implement Gatsby GraphQL queries to fetch data from a CMS or other sources. Integrate Gatsby plugins like `gatsby-source-contentful` if using Contentful as a CMS.
